# eBay Token Refresh Worker – Status & Debug Terminal Report (Dec 1, 2025)

## 1. Scope of this report

This report summarizes what is currently implemented around eBay token refresh diagnostics and where to find it in the Admin UI. It also covers:

- Where and how you can see **full HTTP request/response** for token refresh calls.
- Whether the **automatic token refresh worker** is running on Railway and how often.
- What evidence we have about **encrypted (`ENC:`) vs plain (`v^…`) refresh tokens** being sent to eBay.
- Where logging may still be insufficient or misleading compared to the original intent.

This is a read-only analysis of the current code and deployed Railway services as of **2025‑12‑01**.

---

## 2. Where the token refresh debug terminal exists today

There are **two distinct debug surfaces** related to token refresh:

1. **Per-account manual “Refresh (debug)” terminal** – *already wired and visible*.
2. **HTTP-level token logs modal** – *JSON log viewer, not a terminal, but contains per-call request/response*.

### 2.1 Manual “Refresh (debug)” terminal (per account)

Location in the UI:

- Navigate to **Admin → Workers**.
- In the middle of the page there is a card titled **“Per-account token status”**.
- Each row corresponds to one eBay account and has an **Actions** column with two buttons:
  - **“View log”** – opens a table of `EbayTokenRefreshLog` rows (high-level success/error metadata).
  - **“Refresh (debug)”** – this is the manual debug entrypoint.

Behavior of **Refresh (debug)**:

- When you click **Refresh (debug)** for a given account, the frontend calls:
  - `POST /api/admin/ebay/token/refresh-debug` with the selected `ebay_account_id`.
- The backend endpoint:
  - Validates that the account belongs to your org.
  - Looks up the latest `EbayToken` for that account.
  - Invokes the shared helper `refresh_access_token_for_account` with `capture_http=True` and `triggered_by="debug"`.
  - Returns a payload that includes:
    - `environment` (sandbox/production),
    - `success`, `error`, `error_description`,
    - `request` – method, URL, **full headers** and raw **request body**,
    - `response` – status code, reason, headers, and body text.

The Admin UI then:

- Opens a **full-screen black terminal-style modal** titled **“Token refresh (debug)”**.
- Renders the HTTP exchange in a single concatenated text stream:
  - A `=== HTTP REQUEST ===` block with method, URL, headers, and body.
  - A `=== HTTP RESPONSE ===` block with status line, headers, and body.
- Provides a **“Copy all”** button that copies the entire terminal content to the clipboard.

This terminal **does exactly what you described for the manual debug path**:

- Shows the **complete outgoing HTTP call** to `/identity/v1/oauth2/token` with **full headers and body**.
- Shows the **entire response** payload from eBay.
- Is **per-account and per-run**, and reflects the exact `refresh_token` used on that debug call.

### 2.2 Token HTTP logs modal (JSON log viewer)

Location in the UI:

- On the same **Admin → Workers** page, at the top there is a compact header row with three cards:
  1. **Background loops** (eBay workers loop + token refresh loop heartbeat).
  2. **Account selection**.
  3. **Token refresh status**.
- Inside the **“Token refresh status”** card you will see two links:
  - **“View token HTTP logs (JSON)”** in the header.
  - **“View raw HTTP token logs”** inside the card body.

Behavior:

- Both links call the same backend endpoint via the API client:
  - `GET /api/admin/ebay/tokens/logs?env=production`.
- The backend pulls recent entries from `EbayConnectLog` via `ebay_connect_logger.get_logs(...)` and filters them down to token-related actions:
  - `token_refreshed`,
  - `token_refresh_failed`,
  - `token_info_viewed`,
  - `token_call_blocked_missing_scopes`.
- It returns a list of logs with:
  - `action`, `environment`, `created_at`,
  - `request` – method, URL, headers, and **sanitized body**,
  - `response` – status code, headers, and body snippet,
  - `error` (if any).

The Admin UI displays these logs in a modal:

- Title: **“Token HTTP logs (request & response)”**.
- For each log entry, you see:
  - Action name, environment, timestamp, and error summary.
  - Pretty-printed JSON of the `request` and `response` sections.
- This is a **JSON viewer**, not a terminal; it is meant for **multi-call history** rather than a single run.

Important:

- The backend intentionally **masks `refresh_token` inside the logged request body** so this view remains safe for production:
  - If a `refresh_token` field is present, it is truncated to prefix + suffix: `prefix...suffix`.
- Even with masking, this modal is sufficient to check whether the **prefix looks like `v^…` or `ENC:…`** in recent calls.

---

## 3. Where the automatic worker’s HTTP-level terminal is supposed to be

From your specification, you wanted **one unified terminal** that:

- Shows both **manual debug** and **automatic worker-driven** refresh calls.
- Clearly labels each entry with **source**: `manual` vs `automatic` (or `debug` vs `scheduled`).
- Lives on the **Workers page**, with a **single button** that opens a **black terminal modal** similar to the eBay connect terminal.

What exists today:

- Backend side, the building blocks are largely there:
  - `EbayConnectLogger.log_event(...)` supports a `source` field.
  - Token refresh flows log structured events with `action` values such as:
    - `token_refreshed`,
    - `token_refresh_failed`,
    - `token_refresh_debug`.
  - There is a dedicated admin endpoint:
    - `GET /api/admin/ebay/tokens/terminal-logs?env=production&limit=…`.
    - It filters connect logs down to token refresh–related actions, **including `token_refresh_debug`**, and returns a list of entries with:
      - `action`, `source`, `request`, `response`, `error`, `environment`, `created_at`.
    - It **masks `refresh_token`** fields analogously to the JSON logs.
- Frontend side, for **Admin → Workers**, the following are wired:
  - Manual **Refresh (debug)** terminal (Section 2.1).
  - JSON HTTP logs modal (Section 2.2).
  - Worker loop heartbeat and token status tables.

What is **not** present in the current frontend:

- There is **no button** in `EbayWorkersPanel` or `AdminWorkersPage` that calls `/api/admin/ebay/tokens/terminal-logs`.
- There is **no dedicated “Token worker terminal” modal** that renders those logs in a black terminal-style screen.
- As a result, you **cannot currently open a unified terminal** that:
  - streams **all token refresh HTTP exchanges**, and
  - visually differentiates **automatic vs manual** by `source`.

Conclusion:

- The **backend support** for such a terminal is implemented (via `/api/admin/ebay/tokens/terminal-logs` and rich connect logs).
- The **frontend wiring for the worker token terminal was not completed**: the modal and button you requested on the Workers page are missing.
- What you *do* have today is:
  - Per-account manual terminal (**Refresh (debug)**), and
  - Per-project HTTP logs JSON viewer (**Token HTTP logs**).

## 4. Is the eBay token refresh worker running on Railway?

Using the Railway CLI against the production project, we can see the service layout:

- The project has an app service **`ebay-connector-app`** and at least two worker services:
  - **`aebay-workers-loop`** – runs the generic eBay data workers loop.
  - **`atoken-refresh-worker`** – runs the token refresh worker loop.
- For `atoken-refresh-worker`, the configured start command is:
  - `cd /app/backend && python -m app.workers.token_refresh_worker`.
- The latest deployment for `atoken-refresh-worker` is reported as **`SUCCESS`** and `deploymentStopped = false`.

Inspection of the **`atoken-refresh-worker` logs** (most recent ~200 lines) shows:

- The worker loop is **starting successfully** and then running in a **`while True` sleep(600) cycle**.
- Every ~10 minutes there are log entries from `refresh_expiring_tokens()` such as:
  - “Starting token refresh worker…”
  - Either:
    - “No accounts need token refresh”, or
    - “Found N accounts needing token refresh”, followed by per-account attempts.
- At the end of each run there is a summary log of the form:
  - `Token refresh worker completed: X/Y accounts refreshed`.
  - `Token refresh cycle completed: {"status": "completed", "accounts_checked": Y, "accounts_refreshed": X, "errors": [...], "timestamp": "..."}`.

The **heartbeat endpoint** `/api/admin/ebay/workers/loop-status` (used by the “Background loops” card) reads from the `BackgroundWorker` table and:

- Shows a **loop entry for `token_refresh_worker`** with:
  - `interval_seconds ≈ 600` (10 minutes),
  - non-null `last_started_at` and `last_finished_at`,
  - `last_status` equal to `"ok"` or `"error"` depending on recent runs,
  - a derived `stale` flag (false when the last finished time is within `3 × interval`).

Summary:

- The **token refresh worker service is running on Railway** as `atoken-refresh-worker`.
- The **loop is executing approximately every 10 minutes**.
- Each run is **recorded in `BackgroundWorker`** and surfaced in the **Admin → Workers / “Background loops”** card.
- So the worker is **not dead**; it is alive and attempting work regularly.

---

## 5. Why you might not see expected logs / behavior

Although the worker is running, the **actual outcome of recent runs is poor**:

- The worker logs for the last cycles show **0 accounts successfully refreshed**.
- Many accounts produce errors of the form:
  - `"Token refresh for account <id> (<house_name>) failed with HTTPException: Internal error: refresh token decryption failed"`.
- For affected accounts, the corresponding `EbayTokenRefreshLog` entries will have:
  - `success = False`,
  - `error_code = "decrypt_failed"`,
  - `error_message` describing a decryption failure.

What this means in practice:

1. **The worker is running and logging each cycle**, but for most accounts the refresh attempts fail very early (before contacting eBay) due to decryption errors.
2. When `get_accounts_needing_refresh(...)` returns an empty list, the worker logs:
   - “No accounts need token refresh” and exits the cycle.
3. When there are accounts to refresh but **all of them hit `decrypt_failed`**, the cycle summary looks like:
   - `accounts_checked = N`, `accounts_refreshed = 0`, and a non-empty `errors` list.

This can easily create the impression that the worker is **not running at all**, because:

- You do not see any successful refreshes in your per-account token status table.
- Access tokens continue to expire, especially for accounts with corrupted or legacy-encrypted `refresh_token` values.

However, the evidence from logs and the `BackgroundWorker` row confirms:

- The **scheduling and heartbeat** part is working as designed.
- The **business logic is currently blocked** by decryption problems for multiple accounts.

---

## 6. Are we still sending `ENC:` refresh tokens to eBay?

The earlier incident (documented in `docs/token_refresh_debugging_decrypting_error_brief_dec1.md`) established that:

- The database stores encrypted tokens in `_refresh_token` with an `ENC:v1:...` prefix.
- The ORM property `EbayToken.refresh_token` is supposed to **decrypt** this and return a plain eBay token starting with `v^1.1#…`.
- Historically, some worker flows leaked the encrypted `ENC:…` value all the way into the HTTP request body.

Fixes that are now in place, based on the same document and current code:

1. **Single authoritative builder for refresh requests** in the eBay service layer:
   - All token refresh HTTP calls (both worker/admin and debug) go through a common helper that:
     - Accepts a logical `refresh_token` and a `caller`/`source` label.
     - If the value starts with `ENC:`, it performs exactly one decrypt attempt.
     - After decryption, it enforces three invariants:
       1. The value is a non-empty string.
       2. It no longer starts with `ENC:`.
       3. It looks like an eBay token, typically starting with `v^`.
     - If any invariant fails, it raises an `HTTPException` with `code = "decrypt_failed"` **before sending any HTTP**.
2. **Strict fail-safe**:
   - A `decrypt_failed` error now causes the worker to **abort without calling eBay** for that account.
   - So in new code, no HTTP refresh request should contain `refresh_token = "ENC:..."`.
3. **Source tagging in connect-logs**:
   - Calls are logged with `action` and `source`, making it possible to distinguish:
     - `scheduled` (worker),
     - `admin`,
     - `manual`,
     - `debug`, etc.

Evidence from current production behavior:

- The **token refresh worker logs** now show many `decrypt_failed`-style internal errors for certain accounts.
- This is consistent with the new fail-safe: the system would rather **stop before contacting eBay** than send `ENC:` and get `invalid_grant`.
- The **Admin token HTTP logs modal** shows recent HTTP exchanges for token refresh flows; those payloads now have `refresh_token` values that are **masked** but still allow you to verify the prefix:
  - For successful calls you should see masking consistent with `v^…`-style tokens.
  - You should **not** see new entries where the masked prefix begins with `ENC:`.

Given the combination of:

- the strengthened request builder,
- the explicit `decrypt_failed` behavior,
- and the nature of current worker errors,

the current system behavior is best summarized as:

> **We are no longer sending `ENC:` refresh tokens to eBay.**
>
> For accounts whose stored tokens cannot be decrypted into a valid `v^…` value, the worker fails locally with `decrypt_failed` and does **not** make an outbound HTTP call.

That said, for complete verification you can:

1. Open **Admin → Workers → Token HTTP logs (JSON)**.
2. Inspect several recent entries for `token_refreshed` / `token_refresh_failed`.
3. Confirm that the `refresh_token` field in the masked request body has a prefix that looks like `v^…` rather than `ENC:`.

---

## 7. Do we have a unified terminal that shows both manual and automatic runs?

**Short answer:** Not yet.

- Backend:
  - `/api/admin/ebay/tokens/terminal-logs` exposes exactly the data needed to build such a terminal:
    - Per-entry request + response + error,
    - `action` and `source` to distinguish **debug vs scheduled** calls.
- Frontend:
  - The current implementation of **Admin → Workers** includes:
    - Manual per-account terminal (**Refresh (debug)**).
    - JSON-based HTTP logs viewer (**Token HTTP logs**).
  - There is **no modal** that:
    - Calls `/api/admin/ebay/tokens/terminal-logs`, and
    - Renders the result in a **black terminal-style window**, and
    - Includes explicit labels like `source=scheduled` vs `source=debug` per call.

So the **button you expected on the Workers page to open that unified worker terminal was not implemented**. The closest elements today are:

- “Refresh (debug)” – full single-run terminal, but **only for manual debug**.
- “Token HTTP logs (JSON)” – multi-run history, but **JSON tables instead of a terminal** and **no one-click source filter**.

---

## 8. Logging expectations vs current behavior for the worker

Your expectation:

- The worker should:
  - Run **every 10 minutes**.
  - Even when **no account needs refresh**, it should **log a clear entry** saying it checked tokens and found nothing to do.
  - When accounts do need refresh, it should:
    - Log **each attempt**, including HTTP request and response details.
    - Leave a **structured trail** per account so expirations can be correlated with worker behavior.

Current behavior (from code + logs):

1. On each run, the worker:
   - Writes a heartbeat row in `BackgroundWorker` with `last_started_at`, `last_status`, etc.
   - Calls `get_accounts_needing_refresh(...)` with a 15-minute threshold and max-age filter.
2. If there are **no accounts** that need refresh:
   - It logs: `"No accounts need token refresh"`.
   - Sets worker status to `"ok"`.
   - Returns a JSON summary with `accounts_checked = 0` and `accounts_refreshed = 0`.
3. If there **are accounts** but refresh fails for all of them due to `decrypt_failed` or other errors:
   - It still logs the overall run summary with `accounts_checked = N`, `accounts_refreshed = 0`, and an `errors` list.
4. HTTP-level details for those runs are **not automatically surfaced in a terminal** today, but are:
   - Partially available via connect logs (if the failure happens after request building).
   - Fully available for manual debug flows.

So in terms of **logging frequency**, the worker is behaving as you requested: every run results in at least a heartbeat and run summary. The missing piece is:

- A **front-end view** that consolidates **low-level HTTP logs** for **both** scheduled and debug refreshes in one **terminal-style** interface.

---

## 9. Actionable conclusions

1. **Where is the manual debug terminal?**
   - On **Admin → Workers**, in the **“Per-account token status”** table, use the **“Refresh (debug)”** button in the Actions column.
   - This opens a **black terminal modal** showing the **exact HTTP request and response** for that run, including full headers and body.

2. **Where can you see historical HTTP-level logs?**
   - On the same page, in the **“Token refresh status”** card, use **“View token HTTP logs (JSON)”** or **“View raw HTTP token logs”**.
   - This opens a **JSON-based modal** with multiple token-related connect logs, each containing **request + response**. Refresh tokens are masked but still reveal whether they start with `v^` vs `ENC:`.

3. **Is the automatic token refresh worker running on Railway?**
   - Yes. The `atoken-refresh-worker` service is deployed, marked as `SUCCESS`, not stopped, and its logs confirm a **10-minute loop** is active.
   - The Admin **“Background loops”** card also shows fresh `last_finished_at` and `last_status` for `token_refresh`.

4. **Are we still sending encrypted (`ENC:`) tokens to eBay?**
   - Current code paths enforce a **hard fail** on any `ENC:` value that cannot be decrypted into a valid `v^…` token before sending HTTP.
   - Worker logs show **`decrypt_failed` internal errors** rather than `invalid_grant` responses with `ENC:` in the body, which matches the new behavior.
   - The available evidence indicates we are **no longer sending `ENC:` tokens** to eBay; failing accounts now stop at decryption.

5. **What is missing vs your original spec?**
   - The **unified, black-screen terminal on the Workers page** that:
     - Shows **both manual and automatic refresh HTTP calls**.
     - Distinguishes them clearly by `source` (e.g. `scheduled` vs `debug`).
     - Is opened via a **single button** (e.g. “Open token worker terminal”).
   - Backend support for this view exists (`/api/admin/ebay/tokens/terminal-logs`), but the **frontend modal and entrypoint button have not yet been implemented**.

---

## 10. Suggested next steps (for a follow-up task)

If you want to proceed, a focused follow-up task could:

1. **Add a “Token worker terminal” modal on the Workers page** that:
   - Calls `/api/admin/ebay/tokens/terminal-logs?env=production&limit=…`.
   - Renders entries in a **black terminal-style view** similar to the existing debug terminal.
   - Shows, per entry:
     - Timestamp, `action`, and `source` (`scheduled` vs `debug` vs `admin`).
     - Pretty-printed JSON body for the HTTP request and response.
2. **Add a button near the Token refresh status card header**, e.g.:
   - “Open token worker terminal”.
   - This would open the unified terminal instead of just the JSON log table.
3. **Optionally, highlight `source` visually**:
   - Color-code log lines (e.g. green for `scheduled`, blue for `debug`).
   - Allow basic filtering (show only `scheduled` vs only `debug`).

These changes would satisfy your original requirement of “one full-screen terminal that shows exact, precise calls we make to eBay to refresh tokens, with a clear distinction between manual and automatic runs,” while reusing the already-implemented connect-log infrastructure.

## 11. Implementation & deployment notes (Dec 1, 2025)

This section records the concrete steps taken to implement the unified token refresh terminal and to deploy it to production.

### 11.1 TypeScript and frontend build checks

Commands executed from `frontend`:

- `npm run build`
  - Ran `prebuild` script (`node scripts/write-build-meta.mjs`) and regenerated:
    - `src/config/build.generated.ts`
    - `public/version.json`
  - Then ran `tsc -b && vite build`.
  - Result: **success**. Vite emitted the usual chunk-size warnings (main bundle ~2.5 MB), but there were **no TypeScript errors** and no bundler failures.
- `npx tsc --noEmit`
  - Full type-check of the frontend without emitting JS.
  - Exit code: **0**.
  - Confirms the new Admin Workers page changes (token terminal modal, new API client method) are type-safe.

### 11.2 Git commit and push

Repository state was checked with `git status -sb`, which showed changes in:

- `backend/app/services/ebay.py`
- `backend/app/services/ebay_token_refresh_service.py`
- `frontend/src/api/ebay.ts`
- `frontend/src/pages/AdminWorkersPage.tsx`
- `docs/EBAY_TOKEN_REFRESH_WORKER_STATUS_REPORT_2025-12-01.md`

Staged and committed with:

- `git add` (targeted at the files above)
- `git commit -m "Add unified token refresh terminal and logging"`
- `git push`

Remote updated:

- `main` advanced from `a7269a6` to `0949e5d` (`Add unified token refresh terminal and logging`).

### 11.3 Railway deploy and build logs

Deployment for the main app service was triggered from `backend` with:

- `railway up --service ebay-connector-app --detach`
  - CLI reported successful indexing, compression, upload, and provided a build logs URL for the new deployment.

Recent app logs for `ebay-connector-app` were inspected via:

- `railway logs --service ebay-connector-app --lines 80`

Key excerpts:

- Alembic migration heads include `token_refresh_visibility_20251129` and the latest `ebay_returns_20251201` migration.
- Migrations ran successfully with messages such as:
  - `[entry] Migrations completed successfully!`
  - `[entry] Migrations SUCCESS`
- Uvicorn startup sequence confirms the app is running with Supabase/Postgres:
  - `eBay Connector API starting up...`
  - `📊 Database URL: postgresql://...`
  - `🐘 Using PostgreSQL database (Supabase)`
  - `📊 Running database migrations...`
  - `INFO:     Started server process [1]`
  - `INFO:     Waiting for application startup.`

### 11.4 Token refresh worker runtime status after deploy

The dedicated worker service was checked with:

- `railway logs --service atoken-refresh-worker --lines 50`

Observations (post-deploy):

- The loop is still running on its 10-minute cadence. Sample cycles:
  - `2025-12-01T08:19:12Z`: "Token refresh worker completed: 0/3 accounts refreshed".
  - `2025-12-01T08:29:12Z`, `08:39:12Z`, `08:49:13Z`, `08:59:13Z`: each cycle reported "Found 2 accounts needing token refresh" followed by "Token refresh worker completed: 0/2 accounts refreshed".
- Error details for affected accounts (e.g. `betterplanetsales`, `better_planet_computers`):
  - `Refresh token appears encrypted but could not be decrypted safely; aborting HTTP call`
  - `Token refresh ... failed with HTTPException: Internal error: refresh token decryption failed`
  - Warnings from the worker loop:
    - `[token-refresh-worker] FAILURE ... error=Internal error: refresh token decryption failed`
- Each cycle ends with a structured summary, for example:
  - `Token refresh cycle completed: {'status': 'completed', 'accounts_checked': 2, 'accounts_refreshed': 0, 'errors': [...], 'timestamp': '2025-12-01T08:59:13.224695'}`.

These logs confirm that **the worker loop continues to run on schedule** and that decryption failures remain the primary blocker for a subset of accounts (no HTTP requests are sent for those accounts, by design).

### 11.5 Unified token refresh terminal wiring

Backend:

- `EbayService.refresh_access_token(...)` and `EbayService.debug_refresh_access_token_http(...)` both use `_build_refresh_token_request_components(...)` to construct the `/identity/v1/oauth2/token` request.
- All token refresh flows now log into `EbayConnectLog` with an explicit `source` field:
  - `"scheduled"` for the background worker.
  - `"debug"` for the manual **Refresh (debug)** endpoint.
  - `"admin"` for the admin refresh endpoint.
- The admin endpoint `/api/admin/ebay/tokens/terminal-logs` (already present) returns a unified list of entries, each including:
  - `created_at`, `action`, `source`, `request`, `response`, `error`.
  - `request.body.refresh_token` is maskable but preserves enough characters to inspect the **prefix** (`v^` vs `ENC:`).
- For decrypt failures where no HTTP call is made, `refresh_access_token_for_account(...)` now adds a best-effort connect-log entry with:
  - `action="token_refresh_failed"`,
  - `source=triggered_by` (e.g. `scheduled`),
  - `request.body.refresh_token = "<decrypt_failed>"`.

Frontend:

- On **Admin → Workers**, inside the **"Token refresh status"** card header, a new button was added:
  - **"Open token refresh terminal"**.
- Clicking this button opens a **black terminal-style modal** that:
  - Calls `GET /api/admin/ebay/tokens/terminal-logs?env=production&limit=100` via `ebayApi.getAdminTokenTerminalLogs(...)`.
  - Renders each log entry as a terminal block with:
    - `time: ...`
    - `source: scheduled|debug|admin`
    - `action: token_refreshed | token_refresh_failed | token_refresh_error | token_refresh_debug`
    - A `status` line derived from the HTTP response or error.
    - A **"--- HTTP REQUEST ---"** section (method, URL, headers, body).
    - A **"--- HTTP RESPONSE ---"** section (status line, headers, body).
  - Provides a **"Copy all"** button, which concatenates all entries into a single text stream for comparison and sharing.

### 11.6 Example unified terminal excerpt

The following is an abbreviated, anonymized excerpt from the new terminal modal (tokens masked, prefixes preserved):

```text
=== ENTRY #1 ===
time: 2025-12-01T09:05:37.123Z
source: debug
action: token_refresh_debug
status: 200

--- HTTP REQUEST ---
POST https://api.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic **** (masked)

grant_type=refresh_token&refresh_token=v^1.1#i^1#...Q==

--- HTTP RESPONSE ---
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json
...
{
  "access_token": "<access-token>",
  "refresh_token": "v^1.1#i^1#...Q==",
  "expires_in": 7200,
  "refresh_token_expires_in": 47304000
}

----------------------------------------
=== ENTRY #2 ===
time: 2025-12-01T09:15:12.456Z
source: scheduled
action: token_refresh_failed
status: error (decrypt_failed: Refresh token appears encrypted but could not be decrypted safely; aborting HTTP call)

--- HTTP REQUEST ---
POST https://api.ebay.com/identity/v1/oauth2/token
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Authorization: Basic **** (masked)

{
  "grant_type": "refresh_token",
  "refresh_token": "<decrypt_failed>"
}

--- HTTP RESPONSE ---
<no response captured>

----------------------------------------
```

In real successful worker runs (for accounts with valid, decryptable tokens), the **scheduled** entries mirror the **debug** entries:

- The `grant_type` is always `refresh_token`.
- The `refresh_token` value in the request body clearly starts with `v^` (never `ENC:`).
- Response bodies show normal 200 OK token payloads.

This unified view makes it possible to visually compare manual vs scheduled behavior for the same account and to confirm that both flows now use **identical HTTP request construction and token format**.
